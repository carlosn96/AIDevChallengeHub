## ðŸ“‹ Getting Started

This project is designed to run within Firebase Studio, which handles the environment setup and Firebase configuration automatically.

### Firebase Configuration

The application requires Firebase credentials to connect to Firebase Authentication and Firestore. These credentials should be stored in a `.env` file at the root of the project:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

### User Roles

User roles are automatically assigned based on their email format. This logic is defined in `src/lib/roles.ts`.

-   **Manager**: Assigned to users whose emails are listed in the `permissions/managers` document in Firestore.
-   **Teacher**: Email format is `firstname.lastname@domain.com`.
-   **Admin**: Email format is `flastname@domain.com`.
-   **Student**: Email format contains numbers (e.g., `a12345@domain.com`).

## ðŸ“œ Available Scripts

-   `npm run dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
-   `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
